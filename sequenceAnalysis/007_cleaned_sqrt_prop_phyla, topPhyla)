_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     An S4 Generic method for removing (pruning) unwanted OTUs/taxa
     from phylogenetic objects, including phylo-class trees, as well as
     native phyloseq package objects. This is particularly useful for
     pruning a phyloseq object that has more than one component that
     describes OTUs. Credit: the ‘phylo’-class version is adapted from
     prune.sample.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    taxa: (Required). A character vector of the taxa in object x that
          you want to keep - OR alternatively - a logical vector where
          the kept taxa are TRUE, and length is equal to the number of
          taxa in object x. If ‘taxa’ is a named logical, the taxa
          retained are based on those names. Make sure they are
          compatible with the ‘taxa_names’ of the object you are
          modifying (‘x’).

       x: (Required). A phylogenetic object, including ‘phylo’ trees,
          as well as all phyloseq classes that represent taxa. If the
          function ‘taxa_names’ returns a non-‘NULL’ value, then your
          object can be pruned by this function.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The class of the object returned by ‘prune_taxa’ matches the class
     of the argument, ‘x’.

     esophagus
     plot(sort(taxa_sums(esophagus), TRUE), type="h", ylim=c(0, 50))
     x1 = prune_taxa(taxa_sums(esophagus) > 10, esophagus) 
     x2 = prune_taxa(names(sort(taxa_sums(esophagus), TRUE))[1:9], esophagus) 
     identical(x1, x2)
