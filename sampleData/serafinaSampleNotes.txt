- sphagnum was often not growing on the top of the pals, so other vegetation (especially mosses) was collected instead. 
- the living above-ground tissue was taken, and also the ground-level mixture of soil/vegetation
- no truly-floating mats of sphagnum, as in, un-rooted, but some sphagnum was growing through the water (rooted)
- so they collected the living heads of sphagnum from thermokarsts above the surface of the water, and a bit 
  of the underwater tissue, also. This would be all thermokarst samples. 

"veg_top" = green top of non-sphagnum vegetation
"veg_below" = mix of soil and vegetation at base of collection site. Labeled as "Dead Veg" in AP1, AP2, AP3, AP4
"Sph_top" = green top of sphagnum moss from thermokarst. 
"Sph_below" = submerged (not rooted, not in soil) of thermokarst.  Labeled as "Dead Sph" in AP1, AP3

sph = sphagnum, on palses. Sphagnum on palses was always dead. In thermokarsts, still alive. 

At2, At3, and At5 are all samples from the same large thermokarst in the south. 

All thermokarsts samples that I have (1,2,3,5) are of the same developmental stage ("mature")

Soil cores always from the very top of the palse.
